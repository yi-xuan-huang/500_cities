# Explore Health Status Across Cities in the U.S.

Using data from the Center for Disease Control's [500 Cities Project](https://www.cdc.gov/500cities/index.htm), this app is designed to present and explore some basic statistics and trends in the major health and well-being indicators across the 500 largest cities in the U.S. To see the acutal app up and running, go to [https://healthcare-500-cities.herokuapp.com/](https://healthcare-500-cities.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

This app is a set of interactive and responsive visualizations built with dash and plotly. The 500 Cities Project provides city-level estimates for chronic disease risk factors, health outcomes, and clinical preventive service use for the largest 500 cities in the United States. I think this is a fantastic dataset. This app has three sections, each of which tries to explore one of the following topics:
- How each individual city does on different health indicators;
- How the values of a particular health indicator distribute across cities; and
- Whether there are correlations between the indicators, especially between prevention and behavior measures and health outcome measures.

Here's a snapshot of the app:
